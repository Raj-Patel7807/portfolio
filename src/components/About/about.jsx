                            I am a second-year B.Tech (ICT) student at Dhirubhai
                            Ambani University (formerly DA-IICT). I like problem
                            solving, algorithms, and building things that work
                            fast and efficiently.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Data Structures and Competitive Programming are my
                            main strengths. I have solved 2200+ problems on
                            Codeforces, CodeChef, and LeetCode. I am an Expert
                            on Codeforces (max rating 1621) and a 3-star coder
                            on CodeChef (max rating 1721). I really enjoy
                            Competitive Programming and love learning new
                            algorithms and techniques.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Apart from CP, I am interested in DBMS, OOPS, and
                            backend server-side development. I don't know
                            everything yet, but I can build basic servers, work
                            with databases, and understand core backend logic. I
                            also know a little frontend and can build simple
                            user interfaces when needed.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I am always trying to learn more and improve
                            myself—by solving harder problems, writing cleaner
                            code, and understanding systems better.
